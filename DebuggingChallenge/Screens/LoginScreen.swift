/**
 # Task #3

 ## Task
 Your goal is to pass the login screen by locating and fixing a single bug.

 ## Success Criteria
 Once the issue is resolved, tapping **Login** should transition you to the second part of the challenge.

 ## Important Notes
 - Only one bug needs to be fixed to complete this task
 - Some files are marked as "DO NOT MODIFY" - these must remain unchanged
 - In certain files, only specific sections are marked as protected with clear comments
 - Modifying any protected code (either entire files or marked sections) will result in automatic task failure
 - Unmarked files and code sections may or may not contain issues requiring fixes
 - If you’re unable to fix the bug or simply prefer to move forward, you can bypass the login screen by setting `MainScreen` as the app’s root view to start directly at the second task.
